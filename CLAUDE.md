# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this repository.

## Repository Purpose

PBS Wisconsin Editorial Assistant v3.0 - A database-backed, API-first system for processing video transcripts and generating SEO-optimized metadata for streaming platforms.

**Key differences from v2.0:**
- FastAPI-based API layer (not direct script execution)
- SQLite database as single source of truth
- React web dashboard for monitoring
- Claude Desktop for copy-editor workflow (MCP integration)

## Key Commands

### Development

```bash
# Initialize development session
./init.sh

# Start API server (once implemented)
uvicorn api.main:app --reload

# Run tests
pytest

# Start web dev server (once implemented)
cd web && npm run dev
```

### Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Long-Running Development Harness

Start every session with `./init.sh`, then read `planning/claude-progress.txt` and `feature_list.json` to select the next feature.

### Workflow

1. **Initializer**: Run `./init.sh` to load context
2. **Select feature**: Pick next `pending` task from `feature_list.json`
3. **Update status**: Mark as `in_progress`
4. **Implement**: Complete the feature with tests
5. **Verify**: Run tests, ensure exit criteria met
6. **Update tracking**: Mark `completed`, update `planning/claude-progress.txt`
7. **Commit**: Create attributed commit

### Agent Assignment

Tasks in `feature_list.json` have an `agent` field:
- `orchestrator`: Claude Code handles directly (complex, multi-file)
- `cli-agent/gemini`: Delegate to Gemini CLI for boilerplate
- `cli-agent/claude`: Delegate to Claude CLI for documentation

## Git Commit Convention

**See**: `/Users/mriechers/Developer/the-lodge/conventions/COMMIT_CONVENTIONS.md`

AI commits should include agent attribution:
```
feat: Add new feature

[Agent: Main Assistant]

Detailed description...
```

## Design Reference

The full v3.0 design specification is in `planning/DESIGN_v3.0.md`. Key sections:
- Part 4: API Specification
- Part 5: Web Dashboard Design
- Part 9: Development Roadmap
- Appendix C: Detailed Sprint Breakdown

## Current Sprint

**Sprint 2.1: Foundation & Infrastructure Reliability**

See `feature_list.json` for task queue and `planning/claude-progress.txt` for status.

## Airtable Integration (CRITICAL)

**READ-ONLY ACCESS ONLY.** AI agents must NEVER write to Airtable.

- Agents may READ Airtable data (SST records, metadata) to inform their work
- Agents must NEVER use `create_record`, `update_records`, `delete_records`, or any write operations
- All Airtable edits are made manually by the human user
- If a user asks an agent to update Airtable, the agent must decline and explain this policy

This constraint exists for data integrity and safety. The Airtable Single Source of Truth (SST) is the canonical metadata store for all PBS Wisconsin projects and must only be modified by authorized humans.

## Notes for Claude Code

1. **Check feature_list.json** before starting work
2. **Update progress** after completing features
3. **Run tests** before marking complete
4. **Don't break the API contract** - OpenAPI spec is the source of truth (once defined)
5. **Log feedback** - Append issues to `AGENT-FEEDBACK.md` if created
6. **NEVER write to Airtable** - Read-only access for all AI agents
