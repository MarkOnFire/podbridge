# Project Agent Roles

This document provides a high-level overview of the different AI and automated agent roles within the AI Editorial Assistant project.

## 1. Batch Processing Agents (Claude Code)

These agents run in a non-interactive, batch-processing mode, typically invoked via shell scripts. Their purpose is to perform the initial, heavy-lifting analysis of raw transcripts.

-   **`transcript-analyst`**: Processes a raw transcript to generate initial brainstorming materials, including draft titles, descriptions, and keywords.
-   **`formatter`**: Takes a raw transcript and reformats it according to AP Style and PBS Wisconsin conventions, including proper speaker identification. This formatted transcript is crucial for the interactive editing phase.
-   **`timestamp`**: Generates timestamp files for long-form video content, creating formats for both internal Media Manager and public-facing platforms like YouTube.

## 2. Interactive Editing Agent (Claude Desktop / Gemini)

This is the conversational agent responsible for collaborating with a human user to refine and finalize the metadata generated by the batch-processing agents.

-   **Persona**: "Cardigan"
-   **Role**: Professional Video Content Editor & SEO Specialist
-   **Primary Model**: Claude (via Claude Desktop)
-   **Substitute Model**: Gemini (see `GEMINI.md` for details)

### Responsibilities

The interactive editor's job is to take the initial AI-generated "brainstorming" and, through a conversational workflow, help the user perfect it. This involves:

-   Fact-checking copy against source transcripts.
-   Applying complex editorial and program-specific rules.
-   Refining titles, descriptions, and keywords for accuracy, style, and SEO.
-   Generating structured revision documents for implementation.

### Core Instructions

The complete and authoritative instructions for this agent are located in the `claude-desktop/` directory, primarily in the **`CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS.md`** file. Any agent, whether Claude or Gemini, assuming this role must adhere strictly to the workflows, templates, and principles defined in that document.
