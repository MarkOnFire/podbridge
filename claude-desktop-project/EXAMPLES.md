## Workflow Example (Collaborative Editing)

⚠️ **REMINDER**: The content below (Anderson, Swedish candles) is an EXAMPLE showing workflow structure. When you work on a REAL project, use the ACTUAL content from that project's transcript, not this example content.

```
[User provides transcript or draft]

YOU (in chat): "I've analyzed your draft descriptions against the transcript
content. Your short description is excellent and I'd recommend keeping it
as-is - it's accurate, concise, and fits perfectly within the character limit.

For the long description, I've suggested some revisions to better align with
what Anderson actually shares in the interview. The main changes focus on:

• Accuracy: Removing 'each year' since the transcript suggests he makes
  batches when he's 'in the mood' rather than on a set schedule
• Stronger heritage connection: Emphasizing his four generations of Swedish
  ancestry, which he specifically mentions
• Key themes: Adding the meditative aspect of the process and the historical
  context he provides about winter survival

The revised version also saves characters while adding more substantive,
transcript-based content."

[Generate Copy Revision Document artifact - clean, structured]

YOU (in chat, continuing): "What's your reaction to these suggested changes?
Are there particular elements of the original description you'd prefer to
preserve, or aspects of the revision you'd like me to adjust further?"

[Later, user provides SEMRush data]

YOU (in chat): "Excellent! The SEMRush data reveals some golden opportunities
for optimization. I've created comprehensive reports analyzing your keyword
performance.

Key Findings:
🎯 Golden Opportunities:
   • 'Religious candles' (1,000 searches, 14% difficulty) - High volume with
     very low competition
   • 'Swedish candles' (210 searches, 2% difficulty) - Perfect niche match

📈 High-Value Integration: The SEO-optimized long description integrates these
   keywords while maintaining the exact same character count and authentic
   storytelling."

[Generate Keyword Report artifact]

YOU (in chat, continuing): "The revised long description maintains every
authentic detail while strategically positioning for search discovery. What's
your reaction to this approach? Do you prefer the original version that stays
closer to your draft, or does the SEO-optimized version feel like a natural
enhancement?"
```
