### 2025-12-31 - Sprint 8.4: Cognitive Load Reduction

**Completed:** All 5 tasks (8.4.1-8.4.5)

**Changes:**

1. **Relative Time Utilities** (`web/src/utils/formatTime.ts`)
   - `formatRelativeTime()` - "just now", "5m ago", "2h ago", "3d ago", or full date for >7 days
   - `formatDuration()` - calculates duration between timestamps (e.g., "2m 34s")
   - `formatTimestamp()` - full timestamp with timezone (e.g., "Dec 31, 2025, 3:45 PM CST")
   - `formatTime()` / `formatDate()` - individual components

2. **Applied Relative Times Throughout App**
   - Queue.tsx: queued_at shows relative time with tooltip for full timestamp
   - Home.tsx: Recent jobs use relative time with tooltip
   - JobDetail.tsx: Timeline events use relative time
   - Projects.tsx: Completion times use relative time

3. **Duration for Completed Jobs** (`web/src/pages/JobDetail.tsx`)
   - Shows processing duration in job timeline for completed jobs
   - Format: "Completed X ago (took Ym Zs)"

4. **Simplified StatusBar** (`web/src/components/StatusBar.tsx`)

   - Full ARIA accessibility (role=tablist, aria-selected, aria-controls, aria-labelledby)
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Toggle component for cleaner switch rendering

**Build verified:** TypeScript compiles, production build succeeds

### 2025-12-31 - Sprint 6.2: SST Context Injection

**Completed:** All 5 tasks (6.2.1-6.2.5)

SST context (title, descriptions, keywords, host, presenter, etc.) is now:
1. Fetched from Airtable on job start (already implemented in worker.py)
2. Injected into user prompts for all phases (already implemented in _build_phase_prompt)
3. Documented in agent instruction files with guidance on how to use it:
   - **Analyst** (`.claude/agents/analyst.md`): Align analysis with SST metadata, use host/presenter names
   - **Formatter** (`.claude/agents/formatter.md`): Use SST names for speaker attribution
   - **SEO** (`.claude/agents/seo.md`): Build on existing keywords, enhance (not replace) SST descriptions
   - **Manager** (`.claude/agents/manager.md`): Cross-reference outputs against SST for consistency

**Tests:** 25 worker tests pass

   - Handle CancelledError and other exceptions

4. **Infinite loop guard** (`worker.py:655-657`)
   - Added max_escalation_attempts=10 to tier escalation loop
   - Prevents hangs on misconfigured tier routing

5. **Worker task exception handling** (`worker.py:99-146`)
   - Track job_id with each task for cleanup on failure
   - Mark jobs as failed if exception escapes normal handling

6. **Unsafe phase index access** (`worker.py:1007, 1043, 1094`)
   - Added bounds validation: `0 <= idx < len(phases)`
   - Prevents IndexError if phases modified externally

7. **HTTP client resource leak** (`llm.py:338-348`)
   - Close old client before creating new one
   - Prevents connection pool exhaustion

8. **Manager recovery race condition** (documented)

   - "Clear Failed/Cancelled" button on Queue page
   - Safety guard: won't delete pending/in_progress jobs

**Key decisions:**
- Embedded chat interface tabled (deferred indefinitely)
- Bulk uploader moved from 5.1.1 to 7.2.1 (watch_transcripts.py works for now)
- Sprint 6.1 (SST Record Linking) is next priority
- Sprint 6.3 (Copy Editor Workstation) is high priority after 6.1

   - Added `_analyze_and_recover()` method for intelligent failure handling
   - Manager agent analyzes failures and decides recovery action:
     - **RETRY**: Transient errors (timeouts, rate limits) - re-run at same tier
     - **ESCALATE**: Model capability issues - re-run at higher tier
     - **FIX**: Minor fixable issues - manager applies correction
     - **FAIL**: Fundamental issues - marks job as failed for human review
   - Worker executes recovery action automatically
   - Recovery analysis saved to `recovery_analysis.md`
   - Added "investigating" status to JobStatus enum

   - Formatter: No section headers, act markers, or structural divisions
   - Formatter: Review notes only at top as HTML comments
   - SEO: Plain Markdown output, no JSON
   - SEO: No preamble/commentary before report

3. **Tier Visibility Improvements**
   - Added `get_tier_for_phase_with_reason()` to llm.py
   - Worker captures tier_reason in phase data

- Copied shared assets from v2.0 (agents, templates, config)
- Scaffolded directory structure
- Created feature_list.json with Sprint 2.1 tasks

## Blockers
None currently.

## Decisions Made
- OpenRouter preferred for model routing (simplicity)
- Embedded chat deferred to v4.0
- Claude Desktop handles copy-editor workflow in v3.0
- Using SQLAlchemy 2.0+ async style with aiosqlite
- JSON logging format for easier parsing
