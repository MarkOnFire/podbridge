# Maintenance Backlog

Items are worked incrementally. Any agent can pick up work.

## High Priority

(none currently - Sprint v3.1 tasks defined in SPRINT_PLAN.md)


## Normal Priority / Stray bugs and feature tweaks

- [ ] **Iterate on feature: tweaks to Resources Index template* (2026-01-12)
	- look at production vault version of template and copy those changes, just added a parameter for summaries and a few additional metadata items to the view. 

- [ ] **Iterate on feature: what makes jobs fast or slow* (2026-01-12)
	- Look at job 161. What caused all the model failures, but why was the job completed so quickly?


## Low Priority / Nice to Have

- [ ] **Feature addition: Feedback via GUI* (2026-01-12)
  - Mechanism to give feedback on artifacts produced on automation. Might need to explore the best method but ideally this would happen from the projects screen.
